the first task was quite easy with the most part, i came across a problem when trying to print out list1 list2 and then list3 in the output so i used AI and got the result i wanted to get. in the second task, main code was not the problem but with so much files and folders i managed to mess one up (single folder was made incorrectly) but this was easy to resolve without AI. in the third ask i had to use a lot of ai since i havent worked with such task before but i struggled the most with spot availability checking and reserving the spots (those parts are mostly written with AI). I cant say this was very hard, but it was complicated for sure.

 There are no cases where i needed help and AI didnt give me the desired/correct answer.
